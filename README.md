SERMO 

An app originally intended to be audio live streaming social media app for users to join and listen to podcasts created by hosts , users can also create podcast

Tools used - MERN with socket.io , cloudinary for image upload.

I failed at incorporating the main functionality ie live streaming audio , kept on encountering an issue when tried to add ice candidates from host ( attempted to set up a one to many web rtc architecture using the web rtc api )
However the groundwork has been laid , and i am sure some minor changes would fix the issue but not sure where to make it

A live website hosted on render is attached for users to view and use the app.
